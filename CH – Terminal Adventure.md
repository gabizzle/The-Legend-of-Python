# Terminal Adventure Game 🖥️
Create a ``terminal_game.py`` that walks the player through a captivating mini-game adventure! In each step of the adventure, the player should be presented with 2 or more options on where to go next.

**Some ideas include:**

- A **space-based adventure** of a crew of curious individuals exploring an unknown galaxy.
- A **“Day in the Life”** story that walks you through choices the main character makes based on conditions like the time of day, the actions that the player take, etc.
- A **classic mini-RPG** (role-playing game) with hp health points, character moves like attack/block/heal, and NPCs (non-player characters) that attacks based on a random number generator.
