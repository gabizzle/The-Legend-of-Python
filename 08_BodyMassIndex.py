# 8 - BMI
# Cod√©dex


# The body mass index (BMI) was created by a Belgian mathematician in the 1850s
# and it's used by health and nutrition professionals to estimate human body fat in certain populations. 
# It is computed by taking an individual's weight (mass) in kilograms 
# and dividing it by the square of their height in meters.

# Examples

#score = 2 ** 2      # score is 4
#score = 2 ** 3      # score is now 8
#score = 2 ** 4      # score is now 16
#score = 2 ** 5      # score is now 32

#print(score)        # Output: 32
